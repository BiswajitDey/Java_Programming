This project includes the implementation of different flow cardinality alogirthms for internet traffic measurements :-

The algorithms included are :-
1. Probabilistic Counting Algorithm.
2. Virtual Bitmap Algorithm.
3. FM Sketch Algorithm.
4. Hyperloglog Algorithm.
5. Virtual Hyperloglog Algorithm.

The output for these algorithms have also been uploaded. JFreeChart has been used to generate the graphs.
