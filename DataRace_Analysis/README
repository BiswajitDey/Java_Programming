An example in Java to determine the invariant of a system and avoid data races.
The example includes simulataneous insert/search/remove opearations on a linked list(test cases are limited and can be extended).
The data races in the code has been already addressed.
An interesting exercise for the viewer could be to identify where the data races could have occurred.
